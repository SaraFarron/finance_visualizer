### Finance Visualizer

An application, that I use for managing my personal finances.

### Structure

2 blocks: 1 for data editing, one for visuals (plots, pycharts, etc.)

### Current tasks

+ redo everything below LINE
+ add plots to dashboard
+ create a convinient way to use dashboard (browser? vscode interface?)

### Later improvements
 
 + itertools.groupby()
 + async?
